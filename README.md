This repository contains an application that adds IoT features and new views to the Hypeledger Composer vehicle lifeycle sample application.

## Running the demo without an IoT device

In the IoT flow of the Node-RED flow there are four inputs you can press to simulate IoT events: 'PUSH CONNECT_ATTEMPT', 'PUSH OVERHEATED', 'PUSH OIL_FREEZING' and 'PUSH CRASH'.
