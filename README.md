# Vehicle Lifecycle Demo with IoT Extension

This repository contains an application that adds IoT features and new views to the Hypeledger Composer vehicle lifeycle sample application.

To run this demonstration... (tbc!)

## Running the demo with an IoT device

Requires a [Texas Instruments SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/sensortag) and the [Simplelink SensorTag](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ti.ble.sensortag) app.

## Running the demo without an IoT device

In the IoT flow of the Node-RED flow there are four inputs you can press to simulate IoT events: 'PUSH CONNECT_ATTEMPT', 'PUSH OVERHEATED', 'PUSH OIL_FREEZING' and 'PUSH CRASH'.

## When the demo won't run!
